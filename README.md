Cho-Han, a dice game

Cho-han is a dice game played in the gambling houses of feudal Japan. Two six-sided dice are rolled in a cup, and gamblers must guess if the sum is even (cho), or odd (han). The house takes a small cut of all winning. Simple random number generation and basic maths are used to simulate this game.
